          “Foresight Sports is looking forward to working with the team at
          Sportsbox 3DGolf to deliver technology and analytics that drive
          performance applications throughout golf. The combination of body
          movement analytics captured in such a user-friendly platform with our
          industry leading club and ball data capture should be a powerful
          toolset for teachers and students. Looking at the talent and track
          record of both organizations, the sky's the limit for what we can

          Sportsbox AI has built and launched golf’s first ever markerless 3D
          swing analysis app - Sportsbox 3DGolf - using its patent-pending
          technology that creates full 3D motion data and visualization for the
          golf swing from a single video - no markers or sensors - a technology
          previously available only with a professional multi-camera motion
          capture system with markers and sensors. It’s currently being used by
          coaches in 32 countries - teaching players of all abilities including
          LPGA and PGA TOUR players. Its new product Sportsbox 3DPractice
          provides golfers of all abilities to benefit from data-driven
          practices with real-time feedback on each swing, keeping them on track
          in between lessons.

          Foresight Sports has emerged as an industry force, becoming the
          premium performance launch monitor leader delivering the gold standard

          launch monitor metrics currently available, which is why their GCQuad
          Launch Monitor is the most sought after launch monitor by Tour
          Professionals and Golf Researchers around the world.

          “This is an incredibly exciting time to be an instructor, fitter, or
          player in golf. We’ve had access to detailed outcome data from the
          ball impact and club delivery for a long time, but to combine this
          data with the body motion and swing data is truly a monumental step in
          unlocking the mysteries of the why behind the shot outcome and how we
          can change the things under our control (the body) to generate
          different or better outcomes. And we couldn’t be more excited to
          embark on this journey with Foresight, the global leader in launch
          monitor. The power of the data, combined with the teams of world-class
          experts in golf, biomechanics and sport science, and AI represented in
          our teams and advisors, will advance the entire industry forward in a
          generationally meaningful way.” - Jeehae Lee, Sportsbox 3DGolf

          users. Currently in development, this first integrated product is
