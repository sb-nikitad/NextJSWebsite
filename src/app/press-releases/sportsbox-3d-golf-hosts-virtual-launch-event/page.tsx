          BELLEVUE, Wash., October 7, 2021 -- Sportsbox AI, an AI-powered
          technology company that develops mobile applications in sports and
          fitness using patent-pending 3D Motion Capture and Kinematic AI
          technology, announced today that it is launching its revolutionary
          first product, Sportsbox 3D Golf, on the Apple App Store for iOS next
          week. The company plans to launch on Google Play store, as well, in
          early November.
        </div>
        <div>
          Sportsbox’s patent-pending Kinematic AI technology allows users to
          take one slow motion 2D video from their mobile camera and turn it
          into a full 3D model that can be viewed from six different angles --
          complete with 3D biomechanical measurements of the golf swing.
          Sportsbox 3D Golf can also compare two swings with 3D Motion Data,
          enabling golf coaches to quantify the difference between before and
          after swings or use a pro’s swing as a model reference.
        </div>
        <div>
          Sportsbox wrapped up a successful beta test recently with over 200
          golf coaches, including 32 of Golf Magazine’s Top 100 Instructors and
          15 of Golf Digest’s Top 50 Teachers in America. There were coaches
          from 20 countries represented in the group, as well. In a recent
          survey conducted with the beta testers, 100% said they would continue
          using the Sportsbox 3D Golf app.
        </div>
        <div>
          “I am beyond thrilled to bring Sportsbox 3D Golf to the world and to
          truly democratize 3D motion analysis for anyone interested in game
          improvement in golf,” said Jeehae Lee, Co-Founder and CEO. “We’ve seen
          that with Sportsbox, coaches are able to diagnose and communicate more
          precisely and effectively, and therefore make every lesson more
          impactful. Golfers are able to learn and improve more quickly when
          they receive coaching based on measurements. Sportsbox 3D Golf is
          going to completely revolutionize the industry.”
        </div>
        <div>
          “I have worked on some incredible technology products in the past,
          including Voicebox, where I built personal assistant systems using
          cutting-edge AI, and shipped to hundreds of millions of users through
          companies like Samsung and Toyota,” said Sam Menaker, Co-Founder and
          CTO. “What we’ve been able to create with Sportsbox is by far the most
          innovative and exciting technology that I’ve seen in my career. We
          have an amazing team of scientists and engineers who have all worked
          together to invent multiple new technologies to make Sportsbox 3D Golf
          possible, and I couldn’t be prouder of what we’ve accomplished in such
          a short period of time.”
        </div>
        <div>
          For the time being, the Sportsbox 3D Golf app will only be available
          to download on the App Store(s) to approved and invited coaches. Once
          a coach successfully enrolls as a subscriber, they will receive five
          invitations to distribute to their friends and colleagues as they see
          fit.
        </div>
        <div>
          With the Sportsbox 3D Golf app, coaches will be able to communicate
          swing flaws and changes with students more effectively. Their students
          will also have the ability to practice with clear, measurable goals in
          between lessons, as well as track progress in inches and degrees. With
          older 3D Motion Capture systems, coaches were restricted to studio
          settings, along with cumbersome sensors and markers, whereas with
          Sportsbox 3D Golf, they can now “point and shoot” for immediate 3D
          data on students’ swings -- which they can take from the practice
          range to the golf course. With additional features that will be added
          to this initial product, coaches will also have more robust tools to
          conduct live and remote lessons, reviewing and analyzing swings and
          sending voice-over recordings with 3D data goal-setting.
        </div>
        <div>
          Sportsbox 3D Golf will be available to coaches via a monthly or annual
          subscription. The company is offering three levels of subscriptions,
          ranging from $65-$189 per month with the monthly subscription and
          $54-$158 per month with the annual subscription.
        </div>
        <div>
          There will also be a free version of the Sportsbox 3D Golf App for
          students to download if they’re working with a coach who uses the
          technology. Coaches and golfers will be able to communicate through
          the Sportsbox 3D App and review their 3D Analyses.
        </div>
        <div>
          Sportsbox has built an impressive community of coaches who believe 3D
          motion data is critical to assess and train athletes in order to make
          measurable progress in skill development and performance. Among this
          group is David Leadbetter, a name synonymous with elite golf coaching.
          Last month the company announced that Leadbetter signed on as an
          investor and an advisor. He joined other preeminent coaches, such as
          Sean Foley, Mike Adams and Terry Rowles, as members of the Sportsbox
          3D Golf Product Advisory Group.
        </div>
        <div>
          Sportsbox plans to work with a broad spectrum of elite instructors who
          believe in the power of 3D measurements -- agnostic to swing
          methodology. The AI Coach will be built using the data collected on
          what creates optimal outcomes for different golfers based on their
          skill level and biomechanics.

        <div>Quotes from our golf experts:</div>
        <div>
          “This is a defining day in the world of golf instruction and I’m very
          excited to be part of it… [Sportsbox 3D Golf] is going to be a tool
          that every golf coach is going to want to use. It’s unlimited what
          this technology is going to be able to do in the future.
        </div>
        <div>
          “I’m really excited because it allows us teachers to get the
          information and be able to provide that information to students no
          matter what level of player they are in order to get better. The
          ability to be able to quantify things now is tremendous.”
        </div>
        <div>—David Leadbetter</div>
        <div>
          “[Terry Rowles and I] believe in assessing, not guessing. 3D used to
          be cumbersome and intrusive — now it’s not. I believe [Sportsbox 3D
          Golf] will end up replacing video. It’s instant feedback, the numbers
          are correct, it’s like looking under the hood — we can see everything.
        </div>
        <div>
          “I think everyone who teaches golf should have it. This should be part
          of your toolbox. Once you start using Sportsbox 3D Golf, things start
          to become clearer, easier because it quantifies what you’re seeing.”
        </div>
        <div>—Mike Adams</div>
        <div>
          “Imagine how easy it is for us to get the data now. Previously, you
          had to get these world-class players whose times is constrained, into
          a studio. Now we can just film a swing and compare them accurately
          using Sportsbox 3D Golf.
        </div>
        <div>
          “I use different metrics to compare different swing styles. Part of
          the danger of new technology over time is teachers tend to revert to
          the averages and teach the same thing.”
        </div>
        <div>—Terry Rowles</div>
        <div>
          “The one thing I really like about Sportsbox is the idea of equality
          and giving everyone the same opportunity — this is really going to
          help a lot of young instructors and just a lot of instructors in
          general because Force Plates, Trackman and an AMM system — that’s six
          figures right there.
        </div>
        <div>
          “That's one of the things that really attracted me to [Sportsbox] is
          that it creates an equal playing field for everybody to have the same
          opportunity to use the same grade technology to improve their their
          students but at a price that isn’t gouging anyone. From a holistic
          standpoint, that is something I really support. “
