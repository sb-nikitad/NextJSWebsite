        <div>
          "I've seen everything in the past 30-40 years when it comes to
          coaching tools and new technologies," said Leadbetter. "Sportsbox's
          technology is light years ahead of anything I've seen and dare I say,
          it will revolutionize golf instruction and analysis. It's truly
          incredible that the advanced 3D technology transforms a single video
          into a 3D avatar, capturing over ten thousand data points for every
          swing, all with just a mobile phone.
        </div>
        <div>
          "There’s no doubt in my mind that 3D motion data is absolutely
          critical for understanding the golf swing for all levels of golfers --
          Sportsbox will provide millions of golfers and instructors the access
          to 3D golf data in the palm of their hands.
        </div>
        <div>
          “Sportsbox is really an amazing tool that enables coaches, teachers
          and golfers to observe golf swings as never seen before. It makes our
          job so much easier to pinpoint problems, create solutions, quantify
          improvement and get golfers, no matter their level, on the road to
          improvement quicker than ever before. It’s going to be a huge step
          forward in growing the game. “

        <div>About David Leadbetter</div>
        <div>
          Originally from Worthing in Sussex, England, David began his career in
          golf on the European and South African Tours. He soon realized his
          interest was in the technique, mechanics, and intricacies of the game,
          which eventually led him to spend more time teaching than playing.
          Soon after David’s retirement from playing, he began to incorporate
          his methods and philosophies into a stringent, holistic training
          program for qualified instructors that remains unmatched even today.
          Since launching the first Leadbetter Golf Academy over 30 years ago,
          David has coached players to over a dozen Major Championship titles
          and over 100 individual worldwide tournament victories. Four of those
          players have even held first place in the Official World Golf Ranking.
          With a desire to bring that same world-class instruction to players of
          all ages and abilities, and in addition to the numerous articles
          written for publications like Golf Digest and Golf International over
          the past three decades, David has authored seven books on the topic.
